- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class components have access to react lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Constructor is a method used to initialize state and to bind event handler methods. Render is a required lifecycle method that renders JSX to the page. ComponentDidMount is another lifecycle method that runs after a component is mounted, and it's purpose is to set up network requests or subscriptions.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

A custom hook allows us to compartmentalize and reuse code.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing our apps minimizes risks of bugs and allows us to trust our code. Testing finds bugs, can act as documentation, acts as a safety net when we make changes to code, and makes us think about edge cases.
